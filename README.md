# x-trident-aw109sp-add-ins
Add ins for the excellent AW109SP produced by x-Trident
Not produced by x-Trident, so if these add ins don't work , its not their fault. 

Things that have been implemented up to now. 

Commands for some datarefs which mean they can be mapped to joystick buttons.
Mapping of axes for linear things like rotor brake lever position and emergency / parking brake positions. 

The xlua scripts should be placed into the plugins/xlua/scripts directory. 
Each script must be located inside a folder of the same name. 

Script names have been chosen to avoid know x-Trident offical script names so should be able to co-exist.
